/**
 * TASK:
 * For a particular program, you want to use an entered time value to 
 * tell whether it is lunchtime or not. Lunchtime is defined as the 
 * interval between the times 1200 -1300.
 *      -   Think about how the combination of logical operators and 
 *          comparison operators can describe a compound logical 
 *          expression to decide about whether it is lunch or not for 
 *          the entered time. In this case, you can represent the 
 *          time as an integer, given that you do not use a colon. 
 *          1200 is entered and not 12:00
 *      -   Show an alternative solution where you replace your 
 *          logical operator with a nested if statement (one if 
 *          statement inside another if statement)
 *
