/**
 * TASK:
 * 1.   Animals are generally unisexual, i.e., either female or male. 
 *      Create a logical expression with appropriate relationship 
 *      operators that determine whether a particular individual is 
 *      male or female. Use two different variables to represent the 
 *      male. Thus a Boolean variable is true about males and a 
 *      Boolean variable is true about females. Show how you, with 
 *      exclusive OR (^), can implement a solution where only one 
 *      gender at a time gives true.
 * 2.   Worms are bisexual hermaphrodites, i.e., both male/female. 
 *      Complement your solution so that the combination of male and 
 *      female simultaneously shows the result of hermaphrodite.
