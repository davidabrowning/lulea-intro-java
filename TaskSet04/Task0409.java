/**
 * TASK:
 * 1.   Try to re-implement the loop that prints the message of love 
 *      ten times but this time with a for statement.
 * 2.   What do you find useful about the for loop compared to 
 *      while, do-while?
 * 3.   Try implementing the for statement with index update inside 
 *      the repetition block, that is, with for (; i <10;). What 
 *      conclusions can be drawn with regard for loops three parts 
 *      after running the second example with the same result?
