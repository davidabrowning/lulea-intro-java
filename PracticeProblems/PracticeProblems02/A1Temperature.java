/**
 * TASK:
 * The temperature task structured on Practice Problem 1 (Available only on 
 * Canvas) will now be partially implemented in this task. The code in 
 * Main.java represents the basic structure. Fill in the code under the 
 * headings "declaration of variables", "start," and "print" while 
 * "processing" is saved to another problem titled "Logic - Temperature" 
 * later in the same module.
 * 
 * Just declare the variables that will be needed. Then, ask the user to 
 * enter the needed data. In this case, just the number of days, then print 
 * the variables with the appropriate format and details.
